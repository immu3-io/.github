Immu3 is an on-chain communication technology; (1) infrastructure, and; (2) integrator. It utilizes a permissionless agnostic protocol stack that can support 1000s of on-chain communication dApps to evolve on Web3. Built on top of the Block Labs 4thTech stack, the immu3 acts as the first on-chain communication integrator focusing on the adoption and commercialisation of this new technology.

Users will always have the freedom to move and access their communication or data between dApps, while the developers will always have permissionless access to build communication-specific applications.
