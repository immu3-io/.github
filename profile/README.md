# Introduction

### Permissionless "on-chain" communication protocol stack that can support 1000s of communication dApps to evolve on Web3. ###

Immu3 is the ultimate Web3-Infra stack for building and utilizing on-chain communication applications. The complete developer platform for pioneering the future of global on-chain communication with low-code tooling and configurability developer needs to accelerate from idea to launch. Built on top of the Block Labs [4thTech] OCC (i.e. on-chain communication) technology framework and CR Systems [PollinationX] decentralized storage infra, the Immu3 in essence acts as the integrator focusing on the abstraction, adoption and commercialisation of this new technology.

_"Users will always be free to move and access their communication or data between dApps, while the developers will always have permissionless access to build communication-specific applications."_
